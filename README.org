* Overview
This is a very hacky script I quickly wrote to retrieve my spotify playlists and convert each one into an .m3u file.
I had a large directory filled with music but I wanted to listen to a specific playlist and did not want to manually create the playlist, especially when they had already existed on my spotify account.
Datums like the API key can be manually input or taken from environment variables specified in the constructor.

* Approach
While this script was made to accomplish some quick conundrums, it's created with modularity in mind so it can be scaled in the future.
Right now there's a lot of flaws that need to be addressed- particularly error-checking.
